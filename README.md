Milestone Project 1 MHC Financial Services
This is a highly responsive & intuitive website I am building for my Milestone Project 1; it is for my sister’s start-up company. Its aim is to engage potential clients in an intuitive, easy to navigate website which has dynamic design properties and gives a positive user experience.
It needs to be informative and display in a clear defined manner, what the company is about, its services that it offers and how people can contact them. Functionality and navigation must be intuitive with clear layout and design, while keeping the business and end-user goals insight.

Features
When designing this website, I looked for the design inspiration from various tech websites & accounting/financial websites and UX reviews online.

I have used Google Fonts to determine the best fonts suitable for each part of the website, I.e. Headings, Menu and Body information.
I opted to use ______ font for my website, which is one of the most popular fonts used by major internet companies.

Colors
The colors were determined by the palette of colormind website:
•	For body text and some titles:#_______;
•	For Logo and navbar menu: #_______;
•	For body background: #________.
Wireframe
I used Balsamiq to build the Desktop design of the website. View my wireframes here:

Features
The website is built with 5 pages. It makes website easier to load and navigate. Users can easily navigate website by either scrolling down or going through Navigation Bar.
Navigation bar
Navigation bar structures are the company’s Logo & name with menu items. The Menu includes links to Home, Services, About and Contact pages. There is a drop down bar on the services tab to allow users to select the service they want to visit. Users can easily return to the top of the website by either pressing the Logo or Home tab.
About
About page is built of two columns. The left column is the image and the right column is the text, describing the company to the user and profiling the company’s information.
Services
The service tab consists of one page with 10 parts. The top part is the Taxation section, it will have an image and content showing information on this service and prompting users to enquire about this service via contact link in the form of a ‘call to action’ button. The process is repeated down the page for each service heading. Accounting – Auditing - Business Startup - Book keeping – payroll - vat service – Revenue - Personal Finance & HR. The user will have a well defined understanding of all services available from this company.
Contact
The contact page has two columns. The left column is the contact form where clients have to include their first name and surname, email, phone no and they will be provided a textbox to input a description of what they are seeking. All fields are marked with the ‘Required’ attribute.
The right side is the contact information where clients can view the street address, phone no, email and google map.
