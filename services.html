                <p>Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a tax, which is payable on sales of goods or services within the territory of the Member States of the EU. The tax, in all cases, is ultimately payable by the final consumer of the good or service. Each party in the chain of supply (manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer) acts as a VAT collector.
                    They collect VAT from their customer and include that VAT in their VAT return to Revenue. When returning the VAT collected, they can reclaim as appropriate, VAT which has been charged to them by their suppliers. If you are making taxable supplies of goods and services or qualifying activities, you can reclaim VAT. To reclaim VAT you must make a claim through your VAT 3 return.
                    You are not entitled to reclaim VAT used for making exempt supplies or for your non-business activities. If the costs relate to both taxable and other activities, you can reclaim the VAT used for your taxable supplies.
                    If you are not registered for VAT, different rules apply.
